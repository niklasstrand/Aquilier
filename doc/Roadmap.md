# Problem Statement:
**Exploring Automated, Secure, and Trustless Property Access Control for Short-Term Rentals through Blockchain Smart Contracts**

## Key Objectives:

- **Developing Trustless Access Mechanism:** Explore methodologies for creating a decentralized and trustless mechanism for providing property access to legitimate tenants without human intervention using smart contracts.
# Developing Trustless Access Mechanism with Smart Contracts

## 1. Tenant Verification and Contract Agreement
   
####  Tenant Identification
   - Implement a secure and privacy-preserving mechanism for tenant identification and verification.
   - Optionally, consider using decentralized identities (DIDs) to establish a trustless identity verification process.

#### b. Rental Agreement
   - Define the terms of the rental agreement within the smart contract.
   - Ensure agreement and signatures from both parties (tenant and owner).

####  Payment and Escrow Services

#### a. Secure Payment
   - Implement a cryptocurrency payment system.
   - Validate payment within the smart contract against the agreed terms.

#### b. Escrow Services
   - Utilize an escrow mechanism to hold the tenantâ€™s payment securely.
   - Release payment to the property owner under agreed conditions.

### Automated Access Control

#### a. Integration with IoT Devices
   - Establish secure communication between the smart contract and IoT devices (e.g., smart locks).
   - Secure data and command transmission between the blockchain and IoT devices.

#### b. Access Permission Management
   - Trigger access permission upon payment validation and rental period commencement.
   - Transmit temporary access credentials securely to the tenant.

#### c. Time-bound Access Control
   - Ensure access permissions are strictly bound to the rental period.
   - Automatically revoke access post-rental period.

### Condition Monitoring and Dispute Resolution

#### a. Property Condition Monitoring
   - Implement IoT-enabled monitoring of property conditions.

#### b. Automated Dispute Resolution
   - Manage disputes using smart contract logic, IoT data, payment logs, and access logs.

#### Review and Feedback System

#### Transparent Reviews
   - Enable transparent and tamper-proof reviews and feedback from tenants and property owners.

### Legal and Compliance Management

#### a. Compliance with Regulations
   - Ensure smart contract adherence to property rental, data privacy, and digital transaction regulations.

#### b. Legal Framework Integration
   - Ensure the smart contract is legally binding and adheres to applicable laws.

- **Enhancing Security:** Investigate secure solutions to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that access permissions are securely managed and executed only as per the agreed-upon rental terms.
- **Ensuring Privacy and Consent:** Ensure the privacy of tenants and property owners, and investigate how consent and revocation for access can be managed efficiently and securely through smart contracts.
- **Integrating IoT and Blockchain:** Explore the integration of IoT (Internet of Things) devices (such as smart locks) with blockchain to facilitate secure, automated access control.
