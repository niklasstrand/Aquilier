# Aquilier Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Aquilier**, a fundamental component of the associated master thesis. Aquilier is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to streamline and secure property booking for accommodation, leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain technology.

## Overview

Aquilier seeks to establish a direct, secure, and transparent conduit between property owners and renters by facilitating an agreed-upon smart contract. The primary objective is to explore and showcase how blockchain systems can ensure unerring access to a property for a rightful tenant based on the parameters set and agreed upon within the smart contract.

### Focus Areas

- **Smart Contract Enforcement:** Enabling property access to tenants based on the verifiable and self-executing smart contracts agreed upon between the renter and the property owner.
  
- **Decentralization:** Minimizing the need for intermediaries by facilitating direct interactions between renters and property owners in a decentralized manner.

- **Security and Trust:** Ensuring secure and trustworthy transactions and agreements between parties through the inherent characteristics of blockchain.

Through the seamless integration of blockchain technology, Aquilier not only emphasizes secure and transparent transactions but also explores the multifaceted utilities of smart contracts in real-world applications, specifically in the realm of property rental and management.
